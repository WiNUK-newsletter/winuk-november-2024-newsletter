            We couldn‚Äôt open this month‚Äôs newsletter without mentioning our
            inaugural WiNUK Awards. This was the perfect opportunity to
            celebrate the amazing and hard-working members of the WiNUK
            community, and everyone who has supported us throughout the years.
            WiNUK founder, Elizabeth English, wrote a letter to personally thank
            all of you for the support shown:
          </p>
          <p class="lizzie-letter">
            "WiNUK Awards 2024 was a huge success! Bringing together over 100
            attendees, across our in-person event at the Department of Chemistry
            at the University of Cambridge, and our livestream. We celebrated
            inspiring women neuroscientists from undergraduates to senior
            researchers, trailblazing sex/gender neuroscience research, and
            vital work towards inclusive neuroscience, highlighting mentors and
            communicators. A huge thank you to the incredible Women in
            Neuroscience UK volunteer team for making this event so smooth. It
            was amazing to have 20 of us there in person, after years of virtual
            collaboration. Special mentions also must go to our expert judges,
            keynote speaker, Dr Flaminia Ronca, and our amazing sponsors - this
            event was made possible through your collaborative support! Here‚Äôs
            to 2025, as we look to continue our collective efforts towards more
            inclusive neuroscience, for women and for all." ~ Lizzie

                <p>
                  This day is dedicated to raising awareness about cerebral
                  palsy (CP), a group of neurological disorders that primarily
                  affect movement, coordination, and posture, often due to brain
                  damage occurring before, during, or shortly after birth.<br />
                  CP is the most common motor disability in childhood, and it
                  affects each individual differently. <br />The severity of the
                  symptoms can range from mild, where a person may have slight
                  motor difficulties, to severe, where a person may need
                  assistance with most daily tasks.

              Observed annually on <strong> October 10</strong>, Mental Health
              Awareness Day is dedicated to raising awareness about mental
              health issues, promoting mental well-being, and advocating for
              better mental health services and resources worldwide. It is also
              known as <strong>World Mental Health Day </strong> and is led by
              the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Federation for
              Mental Health (WFMH). We also covered gender differences in mental
